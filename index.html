                <h2>About Our Class</h2>
                <p>Building BXA is a collaborative pop-up installation by BXA Intercollege Degree Programs students to create a welcoming, relaxing, and interactive lounge space. It is dedicated to interdisciplinary exploration at the intersection between artistic and academic scholarship. The Building BXA lounge, featuring custom-build modular furniture, samples of student work, and dynamic wall surfaces, will be open at the base of the CFA south stairwell from December 2-12. The class will officially launch the lounge during the School of Art's Open Studio Day on December 5, from 5-10pm, with a welcome and introduction by the builders at 7pm, and special programming to follow. The Building BXA lounge will also host special events throughout the duration of the installation – watch the BXA Intercollege Degree Programs Facebook page for updates and information.</p>
